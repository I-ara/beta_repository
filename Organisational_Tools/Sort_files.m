%% When you get MRI and fMRI raw data, it often needs some organisation into functional runs and anatomy runs. 
%% This script sorts your original files into a directory with dedicated folders for easy Brain Voyager access
%% This directory can be created by the "Folder Creator" script. 

%% Disclaimer: This script comes as it is - there might be errors at runtime and results might be wrong although the code was tested and did work as expected.
